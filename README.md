# DoctrineBehaviorsBundle
A simplified doctrine extension  to add common behaviors

Yet another fun-filled doctrine-behaviors-bundle. It isn't designed to be the 
end-all-be-all of DoctrineBehaviorsBundles, it's just the way we prefer it and
the way that we use it.  If this works for you great! We're excited you picked 
ours. If not, no hurt feelings.
